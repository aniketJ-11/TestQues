// What is the for...of loop used for?

// It iterates over iterable objects (arrays, strings, etc.).

// Can for...of be used with objects? Why or why not?

//No, because objects are not iterable directly. Use Object.keys() or Object.entries().

// What are the different primitive data types in JavaScript?
// string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, null, symbol

// What is the difference between null and undefined
// null is an intentional absence of a value, while undefined means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.
